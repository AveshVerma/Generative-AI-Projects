Hobbies
I engage in football both as a player and a spectator whenever my schedule allows. Watching football matches is a particular joy of mine. I have a strong affinity for Rock music and often indulge in listening to songs from this genre. I've recently started learning to play the guitar as a beginner. On weekends, I enjoy cycling, and to maintain both my physical and mental well-being, I make it a point to incorporate regular workouts into my routine. I share a passion for playing video games as well. Playing video games enhances cognitive function and muscle memory through complex decision-making and repetitive physical actions.

Achievement in Extra-Curricular Activities

While pursuing my undergraduate degree at Manipal University Jaipur, I took part in an e-sports tournament during a college fest. I achieved first place in Counter-Strike as part of a team and secured the top spot in FIFA as an individual participant.


Awards/ Medals/ Scholarships Received

In my professional environment, I earned the Star of the Month award three times—once in 2021 and twice in 2022—acknowledging my dedication to going above and beyond. I played a pivotal role in the successful development and launch of an in-house product on the AWS Marketplace, attracting clients with the potential for significant incremental revenue. Leveraging my expertise as a Data Scientist, I constructed a Customer Lifetime Value model using Machine Learning. This model proved instrumental in identifying and engaging both newly acquired and dormant customers for effective Customer Lifecycle Management (CLM) campaigns, ultimately expanding the client's customer base by an additional 10%.

Briefly describe yourself by elaborating on your strengths and weaknesses.

I have honed several key strengths that contribute to my success in the dynamic field of Data Science Consulting. My ability for quick and adaptive learning allows me to swiftly master new skills and technologies, while my proficiency across various domains showcases my role as a jack of all trades. I approach tasks, regardless of size, with an unwavering commitment to excellence, fuelled by dedication and competitiveness. Effective communication skills have been instrumental in facilitating smooth collaboration within diverse teams, and my project management capabilities are evident in successfully overseeing a team of two. This involves ensuring timely project delivery, adept client interactions, and resolving queries during challenging situations.

Recognising opportunities for growth, I aim to further develop my critical thinking skills, drawing inspiration from the insightful approaches observed in my manager. Additionally, I aspire to enhance prioritisation efficiency, ensuring a focused approach on critical tasks over less important ones for effective time management. Strengthening collaboration with peers is also on my agenda, acknowledging the importance of collective workload management to prevent oversight of more crucial tasks during time constraints.

What new skills have you developed in the recent past (2 years)? How have you utilized them?

In the past two years, I've acquired technical proficiency in PowerBI, Azure Machine Learning, and adherence to PEP-8 coding standards in Python, enhancing data visualization, predictive modeling, and coding practices, respectively. On the communication front, I've honed client-facing skills, interacted effectively with CXO level executives, and mastered the art of converting business problems into technical solutions, exemplified by optimising a client's supply chain. Additionally, I've developed confidence and promptness in replies, and adopted a story-driven approach in client meetings, making complex technical information more accessible and compelling for successful project communication.

What are your goals in life and how is MBA going to help you achieve them?

My overarching life goal is to make a significant impact in the intersection of business and technology, with a particular passion for data science. Having already gained substantial experience in the field, I see pursuing an MBA as a strategic move to complement my technical expertise with comprehensive managerial skills. The program will afford me a deeper understanding of business principles, strategic management, and effective leadership, providing a holistic perspective crucial for navigating the complexities of the business world. By integrating managerial aspects into my existing proficiency in data science, the MBA will empower me to drive innovation, make informed strategic decisions, and contribute meaningfully to the evolving landscape of technology-driven businesses. The networking opportunities and real-world case studies offered by the MBA program will not only broaden my perspective but also establish connections that will be instrumental in achieving my long-term goal of becoming a versatile and impactful leader in the field of data science and business.

State a challenging situation that you have encountered in your personal/professional life and what were the two major lessons learnt?

It was a recent experience, around Nov-Dec 2023 when the preparation of management entrance was at its peak, and I had back to back classes, mock tests, and have to take out time to study. At the same time, since I was working as a Data Science Consultant at Infogain, I was leading a big project for the client that we needed to deliver during the same time, both the timelines overlapped and both were crucial. I've gone ahead and asked my manager to work on certain weekends, to finish off the project before the deadline, and requested for leaves during the exam time. The manager saw my work, and extraordinary involvement and aspiration to deliver the project before time helped me tackle both the things at ease. The project was appreciated, and thankfully I scored decent marks in the SNAP exam as well.

Facing the challenge of preparing for management entrance exams while leading a crucial project at Infogain, I learned two important lessons. Firstly, I understood the power of clear communication. By honestly sharing my situation with my manager, proposing a plan, and seeking support, we found a solution together. This taught me that open communication is key in managing multiple responsibilities. Secondly, I realised the importance of careful time management. Balancing exam preparation and project responsibilities required planning and prioritising tasks effectively. This experience taught me the value of strategic planning and resource allocation to handle complex challenges successfully.
